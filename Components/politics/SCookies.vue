            We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to
            administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the
            Services. The Services also use cookies and similar technologies such as
            pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively,
            “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell
            us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze
            trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services.
            For example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to your
            interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each
            time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been
            viewed. Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and
            numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when
            you use that device to visit our Site. We sometimes combine information
            collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data
            that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether
            you have an account with us. We may also supplement the information we
            collect from you with information received from third parties. <br> <br>
            Cookies
            can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”. Session Cookies
            are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are
            visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas “persistent Cookies”
            are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our Site
            or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device
            varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your
            preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a
            more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you
            return, how your use of the Services may vary over time. We also use
            persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
            Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online
            activity after you leave our Services. Your browser may offer you a “Do
            Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of
            websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such
            operators to track certain of your online activities over time and
            across different websites. Because we collect browsing and persistent
            identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at
            this time, which means that we may collect information about your online
            activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our
            properties. <br> <br>
            Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and
            may provide information to us and third parties about your browsing
            habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have
            visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These
            Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services
            are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements
            to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are
            relevant to you. <br> <br>
            We do not control third party Cookies. We use the
            following types of Cookies:
        <ul class="aid-list py-[20px] pl-[20px]">

                • Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our
                Site and Services such as by collecting information about the daily number of visitors to the Services, the
                daily requests we receive for particular files on the Services, and what geographical areas those requests
                come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may

                advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who

                https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at
                https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
