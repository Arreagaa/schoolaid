                When your school registers with us and you become a School-based User,
                the school provides us with your Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers
                to information about you that can be used to contact or individually
                identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email
                address, but does not include your credit card number or billing

                payment information for school-related services are processed by third

                We do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you

                your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. Though we
                employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need

                faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current
                judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or
                to protect our interests or the safety of others. In addition, we may

                Privacy Policy. We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve,
