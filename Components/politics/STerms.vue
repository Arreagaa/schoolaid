                not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to a User Submission,

                for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or
                publishing them. You represent and warrant that you own or have the

                Schoolaid. We neither endorse nor assume any liability for the contents
                of any User Submission. We generally do not pre-screen, monitor, or edit
                User Submissions. However, we and our agents have the right at their
                sole discretion to remove any User Submission or other content that, in
                our judgment, does not comply with these Terms of Service and any other
                rules of user conduct for the Service, or is otherwise harmful,
                objectionable, or inaccurate. We are not responsible for any failure or
                delay in removing any such User Submission or other content. You hereby
                consent to such removal and waive any claim against us arising out of
                such removal of any User Submission, whether it is your own or another
                user’s. See “Copyrights, Licenses and User Submissions” above for a
                description of the procedures to be followed in the event that any party
                believes that a User Submission infringes on any patent, trademark,
                trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other proprietary right
                of any party. <br> <br> Schoolaid will not tolerate violations of intellectual
                property rights on the Service. If you are a copyright owner and believe
                that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your
                copyrights, you may contact us through this website
                https://schoolaid.app/ or via email support@schoolaid.app. You may be
                liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you
                materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyright.

                When a student takes a class on Schoolaid, we will share the student’s username and profile with the
                teacher for the purpose of teaching these students on Schoolaid. By enrolling in a class on Schoolaid, a
                student grants to us permission to share that student’s information with the teacher. The teacher is
                required to respect the privacy of the student. The teacher has a limited license to use this
                information only for Schoolaid-related communications or for Schoolaid-facilitated transactions. The
                teacher may use that personal information for no other purpose, such as sending unsolicited commercial
                messages or unauthorized transactions. Without express consent from that person, you must not add any
                Schoolaid misuse any student’s personal information. If a parent uses SchoolAid’s App we will use their
                location only and exclusively to calculate estimated arrival times from school bus services. Remember
                that you need to comply with all relevant legal rules when you use Schoolaid. This include applicable
                data protection and privacy laws which govern the ways in which you can use another Schoolaid user’s

                The membership fee will be billed on the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each
                month or year thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment
                Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. We
                reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your
                Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not
                contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such
                other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Premium Membership or became a paying
                member on March 31st, your next payment date is likely to be April 30th, and your Payment Method would

                liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.
                For some trials, we will require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of
                such trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the applicable paid subscription on the first
                day following the end of the trial on a recurring monthly or annual basis. When you provide a Payment
